## 🧠 Technical Analysis: Why Random Forest Dominates

### 1. **Perfect Problem-Solution Fit**
The algorithm selection problem exhibits clear, interpretable patterns that Random Forest excels at capturing:

```python
# Random Forest learned these decision rules:
if problem_type == "Sphere": return "PSO"        # Simple landscapes
elif problem_type == "Rastrigin": return "GA"    # Multi-modal problems  
elif problem_type == "Rosenbrock": return "DE"   # Valley landscapes
elif dimension > 10: return "SA"                 # High-dimensional
```

### 2. **Optimal for Small Datasets**
- **Dataset Size**: 20 samples
- **Clear Patterns**: High separability between classes
- **Low Noise**: Clean, well-engineered features
- **No Overfitting**: Tree-based ensemble prevents overfit

### 3. **Computational Supremacy**
