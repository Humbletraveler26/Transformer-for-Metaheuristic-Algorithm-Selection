# Algorithm Selection Examples: Real-World Applications

## 🎯 What Our Models Do

Our machine learning models automatically **recommend the best metaheuristic algorithm** for any given optimization problem. Think of it as an intelligent consultant that says:

> *"Given your optimization problem characteristics, you should use **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** because it will give you the best results."*

## 🔍 How Algorithm Selection Works

### Input → Processing → Output

```python
# INPUT: Problem characteristics
problem = {
    'function': 'Sphere Function',
    'dimension': 30,
    'complexity': 'Simple',
    'landscape': 'Unimodal'
}

# PROCESSING: ML model analyzes patterns
model.predict(problem_features)

# OUTPUT: Algorithm recommendation
recommendation = {
    'algorithm': 'Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)',
    'confidence': 95%,
    'expected_performance': 'Excellent'
}
```

## 🧠 Decision Logic: How Models Think

### **Random Forest Decision Tree (Simplified)**

```python

    """
    This is how our Random Forest model thinks:
    """
    
    if problem.type == "Sphere":
        return "PSO"  # Simple landscapes → Swarm intelligence
        
    elif problem.type == "Rastrigin":
        if problem.dimension > 20:
            return "DE"   # High-dim multimodal → Differential Evolution
        else:
            return "GA"   # Lower-dim multimodal → Genetic Algorithm
            
    elif problem.type == "Rosenbrock":
        return "DE"      # Valley navigation → Differential Evolution
        
    elif problem.type == "Ackley":
        return "GA"      # Complex patterns → Genetic diversity
        
    elif problem.dimension > 50:
        return "SA"      # High dimensions → Simulated Annealing
        
    else:
        return "GA"      # Default fallback

        # 2. Get algorithm recommendation (< 1ms)
        recommended_algo = self.model.predict(features)
        
        # 3. Run optimization with recommended algorithm
        if recommended_algo == 'PSO':
